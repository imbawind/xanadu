pre-requirement: Windows 7 or newer, in 64 bit, the source creator currently uses Windows 8.1 64 bit

required programs, these need to be installed/put in place:

* mysql server, version 5.7.x, 64 bit
* mysql workbench, version 6.3.x, 64 bit
* visual studio 2015 (community edition or other), update 3 for it is recommended
* the target maplestory version (atleast the .wz files are needed;
the default game path in the source is: "C:\\Nexon\\MapleStory v0.62\\" (it's changeable in game_constants.hpp))

how to set up the source:

* execute the sql files using mysql workbench

* setup and compile the poco library (or have the already compiled .lib files ready)
1. download poco C++ libraries Complete Edition 1.7.6
2. extract it to C:\\
3. in the Foundation folder, open Foundation_x64_vs140.sln, set the mode to debug_static_md and compile, then set the mode to release_static_md and compile
4. in the Data folder, open Data_x64_vs140.sln, set the mode to debug_static_md and compile, then set the mode to release_static_md and compile
5. in the Data\\MySQL folder, open MySQL_x64_vs140.sln, set the mode to debug_static_md and compile, then set the mode to release_static_md and compile
important Note: when getting compilation errors related to mysql.h file, abort compilation and replace <mysql.h> where the error is with C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\include and compile again/re-compile it

* open xanadu.sln and compile the source (for testing and developing: in Debug mode, for other purposes: in Release mode)
in visual studio do the following:
for testing and developing: use the start debugging button or press F5 to start and debug the server
for other purposes: use the start without debugging button or press Strg+F5 to start the server
Note: Windows firewall or other firewalls either need to be deactivated or when prompted at the server start, allow the server to start to listen to connections and such
